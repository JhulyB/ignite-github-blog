## Overview

### The Challenge
This challenge was part of Rocketseat's Ignite React track. The goal was to create an application that uses the GitHub API to retrieve issues from this repository, data from my profile and display them as a blog.


### Features
Users should be able to:

- View my GitHub profile (avatar, name, bio, number of followers, etc.)
- View list of issues (publications) of this repository
- Filter all issues (publications) of the repository with a brief summary of its content
- View detailed content for each individual issue/post
